The point of this code is to made a RGB LED flash different colors in a smothly fashion. The way i made this happen is to make a timer inturrupt with a counter inside that intrrupt. The counter will count up by one and then when the counter hits 5 it will change the color of the RGB LED. When the color is changed then the counter will reset to zero and then count up again and then change the color again. This will happen infinitly until the code is stopped on code composure. the colors will flas in this list
